Fuel menu

This tool is used to perform setup of network interfaces, as well as configure
Cobbler parameters. The framework is extensible. 

Plugin guidelines:

Create a python class with a filename matching the class:
class foo(urwid.Widget) and foo.py

Place this file in the Fuel Menu modules folder.

Plugin class should define the following functions:
__init__(self, parent)
check(self, args)
apply(self, args)
save(self) #Still need to complete
load(self) #Still need to complete
screenUI(self)

screenUI should use urwidwrapper class to define and set up all UI elements
Note that you need to specify a function for buttons and radio button groups
for them to work properly.  Check and Apply buttons should point to check and
apply functions, respectively.
